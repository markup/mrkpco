    Here’s the thing about me:

    {: .callout}I live to make things work well.

    Good looks are only as effective as the overall experience people have with a product, therefore a holistic approach to design is instrumental in crafting a positive experience.

    Naturally, designers must concern ourselves with how things work, and code is how the web works. Thus, development is inextricably tied to the design process. Development is a design concern because it plays such a significant role in shaping a user’s experience.
    
    This is the basic tenet by which I conduct my design and development practice.

    If you’d like to read my musings on design and development’s role in it, [check out /ideas](/ideas){: .special}, the /markup blog.

      Early discovery and exploration sessions quickly revealed the source of all their web-management woes: They were stuck with a difficult to operate CMS coupled with an inflexible and unpredictable templating system. By applying focus on building a CMS interface that puts tools to work for the user and intuitively represent their relationship to the front-end, along with a smart and robust templating system that makes it difficult to break things, I was able to turn the WFGC’s greatest source of stress into their favorite communication tool.

      {: .intro}In collaboration with [Axio Design](http://axiodesign.com) in Colorado Springs, I designed and developed a single-page website that effectively communicates who Paper Hive are and what they do.

      The folks at Axio were tasked with creating a strong, image-driven identity for Paper Hive, a supplier and distributor of premium papers in Colorado. They had a small budget with which to work, but wanted to give their client a simple website to help launch their new identity. Enter the single-pager.

      h2 A Sense of Place
    markdown:
      An unorthodox therapist needed an identity that communicates just what it is that sets her apart. I responded with an identity that is as nimble and dynamic as her methods.
      
      Heather Monson-James approached me with a problem: she needed an identity that communicates just how special her services can be. In an industry where images of still rocks and serene landscapes have been rendered meaningless from overuse, it was clear her identity needed a completely different approach. Good thing I had great source material.
      
      Through my interviews with Heather, I discovered that she’s the opposite of what one expects from a therapist. She has a pragmatic, pro-active personality that immediately makes it clear she’s in this business to help people move on, not wallow. This is not your typical weekly-visits-for-the-next-decade kind of therapy. Here is a therapist who wants to teach people how to fish.
      
      I wanted to design an identity that captures Heather’s spirit by focusing not on the end-goal (a happy, serene state of mind, often illustrated with the clichés I mentioned earlier) but on the process, the legwork required to work through our issues. I focused on action, because Heather is all about taking action.
      
      With this in mind, I elaborated on a series of Tangram-based logo marks depicting human figures in action. Coupled with strong, crisp typography and thoughtful use of color, the end result is an identity that evokes movement and —like Heather— sets itself far apart from others in her industry.
      
      I partnered with copywriter Merrell McGinness to provide guidance for the identity’s tone of voice. Together, we crafted an identity package that helps Heather steer her brand and grow with it.

      {: .intro}Society of Work is a coworkspace in downtown Chattanooga, TN. Its owner Kelly Fitzgerald commissioned an identity from [D+J](http://dplusj.com/society-of-work), who brought me in to collaborate as a designer and developer.
      
      The design was a collaboration. DJ Trischler provided several layout mock-ups for the most common device sizes, and the rest of the design process happened in the browser. I took a mobile-first approach, using DJ’s mock-ups as milestones and designing in-between stages to ensure that every possible viewport size is served a clean layout that doesn’t look like it’s caught between ideal breaking points.

      {: .intro}[D+J](http://dplusj.com/grid-well) aimed to deliver a responsive single-pager that packs a lot of information, all within a framework that allows the client to maintain the website on their own.
      
      This project marks the first collaboration between D+J and I. While the initial approach was a more traditional designer-to-developer hand-off, there was a lot of consulting during the design phase, and then some collaboration during implementation and development. A minimalist CMS was integrated to help the client take charge of their online prescence with minimal effort, and they’ve since made it their own.

    markdown:
      {: .intro}Soloff Properties needed a single-page website from which to point to her multiple online real estate profiles. It got that, a CMS with which to manage the website and something more.
      
      Elizabeth Soloff is a real estate veteran in Chattanooga and the region. Her business has grown organically over the years, and —as too often happens when small businesses grow without design guidance— her identity was a mishmash of multiple impromptu iterations of one basic idea. After initial conversations with her about her website needs, it became evident that she also needed a definitive logotype, so we worked together to decide on an iteration, refine the type on it, polish it up, and then make sure she has every possible filetype she could ever need. Now her business has a solid, consistent identity that she uses everywhere, and a single website that summarizes all she has to offer.

    p “I just don’t understand how to use my website’s CMS.” This, or some variation of it, is a gripe I hear frighteningly often from prospective clients. I’ve had clients tell me they’ve never —not since day one— managed to grasp the basic workings of their CMS. This is unacceptable.
